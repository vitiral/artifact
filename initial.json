For user documents and project\ninformation, see the project's [README][artifact].**\n\n## Overview for Artifact\nThe goal of artifact is to be a simple, linkable and trackable design\ndocumentation tool for everybody.\n\nThis may seem trivial, but it's not. A useful design doc tool must have *at least*\nthe following characteristics:\n- Allow simple linking of requirements -> specifications -> tests.\n- Easily link to source code (through the source documentation) to determine\n  completeness.\n- Be revision controllable (text based).\n- Have a unix-like command line interface for interacting with your design docs.\n- Have a web-ui for viewing and editing rendered documents.\n- Provide interop functionality like subcommand and data export for integration\n  with external tools and plugins.\n- Be scalable to any size of project (i.e. fast+cached).\n\nThese features will empower developers to track their own design docs and make\nit possible for them to use their design docs to provide documentation and\nguidance for contributors and teamates.\n\n[artifact]: https://github.com/vitiral/artifact\n\n## What is an \"Artifact\"?\n`artifact` allows the user to define any number of what it calls \"Artifacts\".\nAn Artifact is simply a part of a document (i.e. json, toml or extended\nmarkdown) which:\n- Is a single entity composed of a specific set of attributes defined below.\n- [[SPC-name]]: Has a project-wide unique `Name` beginning with one of `REQ`,\n  `SPC` or `TST`, which is the artifact's `Type` ([[SPC-name.type]]).\n- [[SPC-family]]: Has a `partof` attribute which makes it a dependency of other\n  artifacts.\n- [[SPC-impl]]: Has a `text` attribute which allows you to write out the\n  artifact's specification, as well as create subnames which can be linked in\n  source code (i.e. `ART-name.subname`)\n  - [[SPC-impl.done]]: alternatively can be forced as implemented through the\n    `done` attribute\n- [[SPC-read-impl]]: Can be linked in source code using `#ART-name` or\n  `#ART-name.subname`, which allows you to \"implement\" the artifact directly.\n- [[SPC-read-artifact.completed]]: Tracks spc and tst completion of\n  artifacts by (roughly) averaging the completeness of their children + the\n  completion of their subparts, where TST's only affect the TST completion of\n  REQ and SPC.\n\nArtifacts are first and formost intended to be simple and lightweight. They\ntry to stay out of your way and *express what you want, when you want it*.\n\n## Design Architecture\nThe design of artifact is split into several sub-modules\n\n- [[REQ-data]]: the \"data\" module, which acts as a filesystem database for CRUD\n  operations on the user's artifacts.\n- [[SPC-cli]]: The CLI interface. Artifact always aims to be a \"developer first\" tool, and\n  having a full featured CLI with search+lint+export commands is one of the ways it\n  accomplishes that goal.\n- [[REQ-web]]: the webui frontend/backend implementation, which is one of the\n  main ways that users actually use artifact.\n","impl_":{"type":"NotImpl"},"subnames":[]},"REQ-web":{"id":"BaaUD2mLi3hVhv_oRS8sBQ","name":"REQ-web","file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/design/purpose.md","partof":["REQ-purpose"],"parts":["SPC-frontend"],"completed":{"spc":0.0,"tst":0.0},"text":"The web interface for artifact should be designed to behave very similar to the\nCLI/text based interface, except it should take advantage of everything that a web\ninterface can.\n\nMain attributes:\n- Works directly on the file system. Any database introduced should only be used for improving performance (invisible to the user).\n- [[.secure]]: this is definitely TODO, not sure how it will be accomplished ATM. Probably just require non-local host hosting to require a password and use HTTPS (nothing crazy).\n- Fast for _single users and small groups_. Explicitly not designed as a whole org editing portal, users are encouraged to make small changes and use existing code review tools for changing design docs.\n\n# Architecture\nThe basic architecture of the web UI is split into two components:\n- [[.backend]]: this will be a simple json-rpc server which uses the [[REQ-data]] crate\n  to do all of it's heavy lifting. [[REQ-data]] will ensure data consistency and error\n  handling.\n- [[.frontend]]: the frontend will be a single page application which\n  accomplishes a majority of the goals of artifact, including real-time\n  feedback, graphing and visualization of requirements.

Each lint should be printed on their own\nline.\n","impl_":{"type":"Code","value":{"primary":{"file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/artifact-ser/src/lint.rs","line":16},"secondary":{}}},"subnames":[]},"SPC-modify":{"id":"N-jMOn-Fwad9ph6I1wm_dg","name":"SPC-modify","file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/design/data/modify.md","partof":["REQ-data"],"parts":["SPC-modify-update","TST-fuzz","TST-unit"],"completed":{"spc":0.75,"tst":0.708},"text":"The modify operation takes in only the `project_path` and an array of\n`ArtifactOp` (see [[SPC-structs]]).\n\nFrom there, the control flow and high level architecture are\nas follows:\n\n```dot\ndigraph G {\n    node [\n        shape=box;\n    ];\n\n    edge [weight=10];\n\n    {start [shape=oval]}\n        -> {read1 [label=\"read(project_path)\" shape=cylinder]}\n        -> {if_compare_id [\n            label=\"compare ids: orig w/ load?\"]}\n        -> {update [\n            label=\"perform updates and\\n create new project\"]}\n        -> {backup [label=\"backup orig files\" shape=cylinder]}\n        -> {save [label=\"save new project to disk\" shape=cylinder]}\n        -> {read2 [label=\"read(project_path)\" shape=cylinder]}\n        -> {clean [label=\"clean (delete)\\nbackup files\" shape=cylinder]}\n        -> {return [label=\"return new project\" shape=oval]};\n\n    // error paths\n    read1 -> {read1_err [label=\"ERR: db\\ncorrupted by user\"\n        shape=oval fontcolor=red]}\n        [label=err fontcolor=red];\n    if_compare_id -> {compare_err [label=\"ERR: not\\nupdated\"\n        shape=oval fontcolor=red]}\n        [label=err fontcolor=red];\n    update -> {update_err [\n        label=\"ERR: return lints\" shape=oval fontcolor=red]}\n        [label=err fontcolor=red];\n    read2 -> {restore [label=\"restore backups\" fontcolor=red shape=cylinder]}\n        [label=err fontcolor=red];\n    restore -> {read2_err [label=\"ERR: internal error\"\n        fontcolor=red shape=oval]};\n\n    {rank=same {read1, read1_err}};\n    {rank=same {if_compare_id, compare_err}};\n    {rank=same {update, update_err}};\n    {rank=same {read2, restore}};\n    {rank=same {clean, read2_err}};\n}\n```\n\nOverall this is *relatively simple*.

These types are used for:\n- linting after reading the project\n- inteacting with the CRUD interface.\n\n#### [[.artifact_op]]: ArtifactOp:\n- `Create(ArtifactIm)`: create an artifact, it must not already exist.\n- `Update(HashIm, ArtifactIm)`: update the artifact with the specified hash.\n- `Delete(HashIm)`: delete the artifact with the specifed hash.\n\nThis is the \"operation\" command used by [[SPC-modify]] for modifying artifacts.\n`Read` is ommitted as it is covered by [[SPC-read]].\n\n#### [[.artifact_im]]: ArtifactIm:\n- name: `Name`\n- file: `PathAbs`\n- partof: `Set<Name>` (auto-partofs are stripped)\n- done: `Option<String>`\n- text: `String`\n\nThe `ArtifactIm` is used to create a unique 128 bit hash of the artifacts and\nfor specifying *what* should be updated when an update is requested.\n\nThis is also the primary type used when linting.\n\n#### HashIm:\nThis is simply a 128 bit SipHash created by the [`siphasher` crate][1].\n\n[1]: https://doc.servo.org/siphasher/sip128/struct.Hash128.html\n\n\n## Type Details\n\n**Artifact**: ([[.artifact]]) the artifact is the primary exported type. It contains:\n  - `name`: the unique identifier of the artifact.\n  - `file`: the file where the artifact is defined.\n  - `partof` and `parts`: automatic and user-defined relationship to other\n    artifacts where `B in A.partof` means that B is a \"parent\" of A.\n    More details are in [[SPC-family]].\n  - `completed`: the `spc` and `tst` completion ratios, detailing how much of\n    the artifact's specification and test design has been implemented.\n  - `text`: the user defined text in the markdown format.\n  - `impl_`: how the artifact is implemented (if it is implemented at all). Can\n    be `Done(str)`, `Code(ImplCode)` or `NotIMpl`.\n  - `subnames`: a list of subnames defined in `text` using `{{.subname}}`\n    except `[[]]` instead of `[[]]`. These can be linked in code to complete\n    the artifact.\n  - `orig_hash`: the original hash of the `ArtifactIm` this was created from.\n\n**Name**:\n  - name is of the form `ART-name` where ART is one of {`REQ`, `SPC` or `TST`}\n  - more details are in [[SPC-name]].\n\n**Impl**:\n  - Defines how the artifact is implemented.\n  - `Done`: can be \"defined as done\" through the `done` field in the\n    `ArtifactRaw`.\n  - `Code`: can be implemented in code, where source code just puts `#ART-name`\n    anywhere to mark an artifact as implemented.\n","impl_":{"type":"Code","value":{"primary":null,"secondary":{".artifact":{"file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/artifact-lib/src/lib.rs","line":51},".artifact_im":{"file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/artifact-lib/src/lib.rs","line":231},".artifact_op":{"file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/artifact-lib/src/lib.rs","line":301}}}},"subnames":[".artifact",".artifact_im",".artifact_op",".artifact_raw",".text_raw"]},"SPC-test":{"id":"8rQUkI1Y_vjFCkDMYwj9Jg","name":"SPC-test","file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/design/data/purpose.md","partof":["REQ-data"],"parts":[],"completed":{"spc":0.0,"tst":0.0},"text":"This requirement details the *exported* functions, classes and framework for\nmaking testing artifact projects simpler and more robust.\n\nThere are three pieces of this requirement:\n- Definition of exported \"helper\" methods and types for testing  artifact.\n  This is not defined further, but should be clear from reading the test source\n  code documents.\n- Definition of exported \"fuzzing\" methods for fuzz testing artifact\n- Definition of exported \"test framework\" for creating examples and assertions\n  using a simple file structure.\n","impl_":{"type":"NotImpl"},"subnames":[]},"TST-framework":{"id":"CV436XvzdYFUm9B47_pR_Q","name":"TST-framework","file":"/home/garrett/code/artifact/design/data/purpose.md","partof":["REQ-purpose"],"parts":[],"completed":{"spc":1.0,"tst":1.0},"text":"> TODO: make it partof REQ-data\n> partof: REQ-data\n> ###\n\nThere shall be a \"interop test framework\" constructed for doing interop testing.\nThe basic design is:\n- *Each test is a full project* (folder with a `.art` folder, source files and\n  design documents).\n- Each test contains assertions in various files.

The goal is that\nfunction from this harness be reused for writing even higher level tests.\n\nThe major elements of the harness are:\n- An `assert_deser_valid(deser, raw, expected)` which:\n    - converts `raw -> result` using `deser(raw)`\n    - asserts `expected == result`\n    - return value\n- An `assert_ser_valid(ser, value, expected)` which:\n    - converts `value -> raw` using `ser(value)`\n    - asserts `result == expected` with a decent diff\n    - return raw\n- An `assert_serde(value, expected_raw_toml, expected_raw_md)` function which:\n    - does a round trip on the inpult and asserts for all the given types\n    - `raw_toml = assert_ser_valid(toml::ser, value, expected_raw_toml)`\n    - `assert_de_valid(toml::de, raw_toml, value)`\n    - `raw_md = assert_ser_valid(from_markdown, value, expected_raw_md)`\n    - `assert_de_valid(to_markdown, raw_md, value)`\n- Fuzzing for `ArtifactRaw`, whch creates fuzzed ArtifactRaw objects and runs\n  round-trip tests on them.\n\nThe fuzzing design is of particular importance, since it is intended to be\nused by even higher level test frameworks.
