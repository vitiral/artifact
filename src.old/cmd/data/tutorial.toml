# Welcome to the artifact tutorial! This file is written just like
# artifact toml files are.
#
# You can get to this stage in the tutorial at any time by running:
#
#     art tutorial
#
# Artifact is a command line, text based tool for writing and tracking design
# documents. It aims to be easy to use by anybody and especially productive
# for developers
#
# Follow along with this file to get an idea of how you can
# easily write and track requirements in your source code
#
# Before we continue too far, why don't you try a command? Type
# the following command:
#
#     art ls REQ-learn -l
#
# You should see a colorized artifact (unless you are on windows, in which case
# there won't be color). If you do, good. If you are having problems try going
# back to the installation tutorial at github.com/vitiral/artifact

[REQ-learn]
text = '''
Artifacts can be a requirement (REQ), design-specification (SPC)
or test (TST)

Artifacts are defined by specifying their name like so: "[REQ-NAME]".
This particular artifact is a requirement, therefore it begins with
"REQ". After REQ there is a "-" and then the name of the requirement.

Unlike many requirements tracking tools, artifact encourages the use
of human-readable names. We will talk more about this later.

Goto [[REQ-toml]] next.
'''

[REQ-toml]
partof = 'REQ-learn'
text = '''
Artifact files like this one are written in the TOML format
you can read more about it here: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

All artifact files must end in ".toml"

Artifact names must be composed of the set "a-zA-Z_-", case is ignored.

Go to [[SPC-learn]] next.
'''


[SPC-learn]
partof = 'REQ-toml'
text = '''
Anything starting with SPC is a design specification and is the only way
that a requirement can be considered "completed". Requirements (REQ)
should be used for detailing "what you want your application to do" and
design specifications (SPC) should be used for detailing "how your application
will do it".

There are also tests (TST) which we will learn about later.

Goto [[SPC-partof]] next.
'''

[SPC-partof]
partof = 'REQ-learn'
text = '''
Artifact uses the names of artifacts to automatically link them and track
progress. This makes it easy for the user to intuitively link together
requirements with their specification and reduces boilerplate.

[[SPC-learn]] is automatically a "partof" [[REQ-learn]] because the names after
the type are the same ("-learn")

So far we have:
```
REQ-learn <------ SPC-learn
    ^-- REQ-toml <---/
    |
    \---REQ-partof <-- SPC-partof
```

So not very interesting, as everything is only linked by name.
See [[TST-partof]] next.
'''

[SPC-example]
text = "only used as an example for [[TST-partof]]"


[TST-partof]
partof = [
    'SPC-learn',
    'SPC-example',
]
text = '''
First of all, this is how you specify a TST.

Also, notice the `partof` field is a list to specify more than
one artifact.

See [[SPC-valid]] next.
'''

[SPC-valid]
text = '''
There are only a few rules for defining artifacts:
 - case is ignored for all names
 - names cannot overlap, even in different files
 - all names must start with either REQ, SPC or TST
 - artifact names must follow [[SPC-links]] (see this next)
'''

[SPC-links]
partof = 'SPC-partof'
text = '''
There are some rules for which artifacts can be a partof other artifacts:
- All artifacts can be a partof their own group (i.e. SPC can be a partof SPC,
  REQ partof REQ, etc)
- SPC can be a partof REQ
- TST can be a partof SPC

Here is a helpful graph of valid relations:
```
  REQ <-- SPC <-- TST
```

In other words, you can design a spec (SPC) based on a requirement (REQ).
Tests (TST) can then test to the spec (SPC).

See [[SPC-tst]] next.
'''

[SPC-tst]
text = '''
TST is used to document test design and is the only way that an artifact can be
considered "tested".

Artifact makes it easy to track the "progress" of your application because
`art ls` (and the web-ui) gives you easy to easy to read completion and
tested percentages for all your artifacts based on which ones are implemented
in source code (more on that later).

See [[SPC-learn-ls]] next.
'''

[SPC-cmd]
text = '''
Artifact has only a few commands and all of them are useful for typical
operation.

For this part of the tutorial we are going to focus on the following:
- [[SPC-cmd-ls]]: the `ls` (list) command allows you to view and filter your
  artifacts over the command line easily
- [[SPC-cmd-serve]]: the `serve` command gives you a web-ui that you can use to
  view, filter and edit your artifacts.

Go to [[SPC-cmd-ls]] next.
'''

[SPC-cmd-ls]
text = '''
The `ls` command is one of the most important command to learn in artifact,
as it helps you manage the artifacts in your project, see how they are linked,
and view how completed/tested they are.

Type:
    art ls SPC-learn-ls -l

This will show you this artifact, pretty printed on your terminal.

Try:
    art ls learn -p

This searches in the "name" field for all artifacts that have "learn"
in their name.

Let's say you wanted to find an artifact, and all you knew was that it mentioned
files in it's text field. You could run:

    art ls file -p text --text
    # OR
    art ls file -p T -T

This will search for the pattern "file" in the text field
(specified with `-p T`). It will also display a short piece of the text field
(specified with `-T`).

Now let's say that you see that SPC-learn-valid is what you were looking for,
but you want an expanded view:

   art ls SPC-learn-valid -l

Now you see that SPC-learn-valid has not been tested or implemented and that it
is partof SPC-LEARN. From there you could decide what to do.

See [[SPC-cmd-serve]] next.

type `art serve` and goto the following link in your browser:

As you can see, this tutorial has been rendered via the web. You can explore,
click the links and even edit artifacts in place (edits will change this file).
