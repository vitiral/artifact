# Artifact Introduction

Welcome to the Artifact Tutorial and Simple Quality Leaflet!

This "book" (it is a very small book) also serves as the tutorial for
[artifact][artifact], the design documentation tool made for everybody
(including developers!). You can get this book on the project's home
design documents (**TODO: add link**) and it also ships with the Web UI of
every artifact (just follow the **docs** in the header).

Artifact is a simple, linkable and trackable design documentation tool for
everybody. It allows anyone to write and link their design documents both to
each other and to source code, making it easy to know how complete their
project is. Documents are revision controllable, can be edited in the browser
and have a full suite of command line tools for searching, displaying,
checking, exporting and formatting them.

This book is broken into 3 main sections:
- Artifact introduction: introducing you to the syntax and basic philosophy of
  artifact.
- Simple Quality: an interactive guide for achieving high quality with minimal
  effort geared more towards beginner to intermediate software developers.
- Addendum: complete list of features, fullpage specification, etc.
