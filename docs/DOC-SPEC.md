# Artifact Document Specification

This document outlines the specification for the Artifact data format.
All specifications in this document are released as Creative Commons CC0

## Document Type

Artifact documents adhere to a subset of the [toml][1] format and are
documents of the form:

```toml
[ART-baz]
partof = "ART-baa"
text = '''
multi-line
description
'''

[ART-foo-bar]
partof = "ART-baz"
text = '''
multi-line
description
'''
```

## Artifact Types

Instead of `ART` as defined in Document Type, the user must select from
3 artifact types:
- `REQ`: specifying a requirement. `REQ` can only have `REQ` in its
  `partof` field.
- `SPC`: specifying a design specification. `SPC` can only have
  `REQ` or `SPC` in its `partof` field.
- `TST`: specifying a test of a `SPC`. `TST` can only have
  `SPC` or `TST` in its `partof` field.

## Automatic Creation

The following will be automatically created:
- parents: if `REQ-foo-bar` is specified but `REQ-foo`
    does not exist then it will be created. Parents
    of all artifacts are guaranteed to exist.

## Automatic Links

The following will be automatically linked:
- parents: `REQ-foo` will automatically be a `partof`
    `REQ-foo-bar`
- common-prefix for `REQ -> SPC -> TST` links
    - `REQ-foo` will automatically be a `partof` `SPC-foo`
        *if `REQ-foo` exists*
    - `SPC-foo` will automatically be a `partof` `TST-foo`
        *if `SPC-foo` exists*
