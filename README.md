Artifact is the simple, linkable and trackable design documentation tool for
everybody. It allows anyone to write and link their design documents both to
each other and to source code, making it easy to know how complete their
project is. Documents are revision controllable, can be edited in the browser
and have a full suite of command line tools for searching, displaying,
checking, exporting and formatting them.

Writing detailed design documents is one of the core pillars of quality software
development. Design documents are how you capture the requirements (purpose) of
your project and link them to your specifications (how you will build it). They
let you get your ideas on paper before writing code, and help you have fewer
painful refactors. They create a reference for developers and curious users of
how and why your project was developed a certain way, and make it easier to
refactor your project when that becomes necessary.

Even though design documents are critical to the quality of software, there
are very few tools for writing them and integrating them into the larger context
of a project. Artifact aims to fill the major gap in quality best practices by
making writing good design documents *useful* to the average developer.

First of all, artifact makes it easy to write design documents in *text files*
and link them by just specifying their `partof` attribute. This allows
developers to put their design documents under revision control, review them
using regular code review tools and use all the normal text processing tools
(vim, grep, sed, etc) to view, edit and refactor them. Artifact also provides
some command line tools of its own.

Secondly, design documents can be linked to source-code through a language
agnostic syntax (`#ART-name` anywhere in the source code). Once linked, anyone
reading the comment can easily look up the relevant design documents. In the
same way, anyone looking at the Web UI can see exactly where a specification or
test is implemented in code. Furthermore, if the name of a design doc changes,
`art check` will tell you where your dangling references are. Never again will
you have to be scared of refactoring your design documents because your
references in code will be out of date.

Finally, artifact exports a beautiful rendered view of your design documents
onto sites like github-sites ([example][2]) and you can edit in your browser
using `art serve`. This completes the self documenting nature and allows
anyone (even non-developers!) to view and edit the design documents of their
project.

In this way, artifact aims to unify other quality best practices while also
make writing design documents more fun and useful in your day to day
development efforts.
